## 🚀 About The Project

**Image manipulator** is an AI-powered creative workbench designed to bridge the gap between imagination and execution. 

Built using **Python** and **Diffusers**, this tool allows users to modify images using natural language instructions (e.g., *"Make it look like a sketch"* or *"Change the weather to rain"*). It leverages the **InstructPix2Pix** model to perform edits while preserving the structural integrity of the original image—something standard text-to-image models struggle with.

I built this project to demonstrate:
* **Full-Stack ML Engineering:** Integrating PyTorch models with a frontend UI.
* **UX Design:** Creating a dark-mode, distraction-free interface for artists.
* **Optimization:** Tuning inference parameters (CFG, Steps) for optimal performance.

## ⚡ Features

* **Instruction-Based Editing:** No complex prompting; just tell the AI what to change.
* **Granular Control:**
    * **Structure Retention:** Control how much the AI respects the original edges.
    * **Creativity Scale:** Adjust how strictly the AI follows the text instruction.
* **One-Click Presets:** Built-in styles for Architecture, Cinematic rendering, and Digital Art.
* **Modern UI:** Responsive Streamlit interface with a custom dark theme.
